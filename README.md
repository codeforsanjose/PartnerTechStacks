PARTNER TECH STACKS
===================

## WHY 

These questions were prompted by reading [this Code for America article](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/07/17/how-to-pick-the-right-tech-stack/) and realizing that I know zip about the City of San Jose's current tech stack, and that all the Code for San Jose projects I'd looked at to date were basically standalone, not (apparently) intended to be ever turned over to the City (or VTA or other organization) to maintain.

That seems unfortunate on several levels. Creating a simple  proof-of-concept app is one thing, maintaining it as an ongoing service is another, especially if you want *someone else* to take over maintenance at some point.  

From the cited article:

> Each city had a unique need. Denver wanted to ensure their staff could start building out of the gate with existing skills. San Antonio wanted their team to learn new skills and expand their toolkit to include new development methodologies. Atlanta wanted something that could be easily updated using a visual editor.

> Figuring out these needs required each city to be honest with the fellows about their technical capabilities, and for the fellows to carefully observe and experiment with different technology choices to find the best option for their government partners.

So in the interests of providing all CfSJ participants (particularly developers) a better understanding of San Jose information technology, I'm looking to fill in as much as possible about all of the following.

## HOW

In the interests of keeping it all in one place, I suggest that whoever has input on this use the GitHub wiki.

## WHO

Anyone. If there's anything significant not listed below, please add it :-)

## WHAT

### PROCUREMENT

Does the organization favor 
 
1. purchased proprietary solutions
2. FOSS solutions

*Note that one might be "preferred" but still part of a mix. And even FOSS solutions may involve paid third-party support.*

Is the organization open to using SaaS solutions via the web, or does it require internally-deployed server-based solutions? 

Does the organization 

1. keep development primarily in-house
2. use third-party solution providers
3. rely on product vendors for integration and support

*Again, a mix of approaches is possible.*


### PLATFORM

What is the primary software development platform, e.g. Java, .NET, etc.

There's a whole range of stuff here I'd find potentially interesting:

1. Desktops: Win, Mac, Linux, cloud?
2. Primary development tools: IDEs, VCS, CI, other test tools
3. Developer communication tools: Slack, Skype, etc.

### DEPLOYMENT

Does the organization 

1. run its own infrastructure
2. lease fixed external hosting 
3. use flexible deployment via cloud vendors (Heroku, AWS, Rackspace, etc.)

### CULTURE

Is the development organization hierarchical? agile? Are people rewarded or punished for trying new things? Are organizational units heavily siloed?
